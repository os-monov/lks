# Local Kafka Service

Local Kafka Service is a fun exercise of a single-node kafka compatabile server that persists messages to S3. For the purpose

## Control Plane
### Creating a Topic
The majority of the code is revolves around producing & fetching messages for a single topic. However, for consistency's sake, this server has an endpoint that creates a topic with a default 100 partitions. The service doesnt not support configuring this setting and 

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/topics -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"hello"}'
```
Request: { 200: Topic}
Response: (409: TopicAlreadyExistsException)

## Data Plane
### Producing Messages

Note: Messages need to be less than 1Kb.

```bash
CURL -X POST http://localhost:8123/topics/hello/produce/0 -d "key:value"
```

- partition segment (offset and not duplicating data)
-

## Compaction

## Failure Scenarios
- slow flush beats newer flush()
- flushing on size instead of time

## Testing

## Distributed System
#### Metadata Service -> Strongly Consistent Commits
#### FileStorage Service -> S3
##### latency -> 100ms
#### Maintaining Offset -> Hash Request to Same Agent
#### Heartbeat Monitoring -> Metadata Service
#### Re-routing request (similar to Redis)
